 I designed and developed a modern, interactive stopwatch web application
A professional UI with neon effects and responsive design
Start, pause, reset, and lap time functionality
Animated lap tracking and smooth user experience
This project helped me strengthen my JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills while focusing on user experience and clean design.
Excited to keep building more!
